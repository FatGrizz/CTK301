  <p class="p1"> Feb 18, 2021 - So, real talk. We need your help. Packzi Day is usually one of our busiest days of the year - but this year it was slow. The ongoing pandemic along with the weather were the main factors of course. That said, we are so incredibly grateful for all of your continued support, but we are struggling a bit. Whether it's one donut or dozens - we would greatly appreciate your business. Packzi? You don't have to wait another year to enjoy those! We can make those fresh for you any time with 24 hours notice! Call us or mask up and visit us in the shop 24/7! We can't thank you enough! (847)-358-7935 #SpunkyDunkers </p>

  <p class="p2"> Feb 20, 2021 -  We truly cannot thank you all enough. We‚Äôre speechless. We‚Äôre gonna keep crankin‚Äô out donuts! Please, be safe. Wear a mask and keep your distance from others if you‚Äôre in line. Again, we cannot thank you enough for your unbelievable support! </p>

  <p class="p3"> Feb 21, 2021 - In all these years, we've never had to do something like this - but effective immediately we are closed until midnight tomorrow. Simply put, the overwhelming response has completely run us dry. At this very moment, we literally cannot make another donut! Wüç©W. You are all so amazing. This is not a bad thing. We are not going anywhere. We just need to reset, get more supplies and get back to crankin' out donuts 24/7. If you had orders for pickup on Monday, they will be ready on Tuesday. We appreciate your patience! Again, we simply have been run dry. We're working on getting more supplies right away and we'll be business as usual on Tuesday! From the bottom of our hearts (and donut deep fryers) - Thank you! #SpunkyDunkers </p>
