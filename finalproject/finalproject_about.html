    <p>Hello! Welcome to my web portfolio! This is where you can check out everything that I have done with my life that's good enough to give a platform. Go to my contact page to figure out how to get in contact with me. Let me know what you think!</p>
    <p>I grew up in a northwest suburb of Chicago called Arlington Heights. Throughout my entire life, creative technologies has been a massive influence on me. My parents introduced me to computers when I was only a couple years old. Ever since then, I've always found a way to use it to create something awesome (or at least that I thought was awesome!) </p>
    <p>I graduated from Rolling Meadows High School in 2015 and decided I would go for a BA in Graphic Design because that was the path I thought I saw myself in. However, after one year  at Harper College and two of my four years at UW-Whitewater, I found a new path in Electronic Media (Audio and Video based) and haven't looked back since. I graduated from UW-Whitewater in May 2020 with a BA in Communications - Electronic Media and a minor in Music (Percussion emphasis).</p>
    <p>I currently attend Illinois State University to pursue an MS in Creative Technologies and am expected to graduate in May 2022.</p>
