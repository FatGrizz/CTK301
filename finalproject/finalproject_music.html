    <p>Welcome to my music tab! As this portfolio is still in development, I think this is my favorite part of this portfolio for multiple reasons. To give a brief background on my music career, I have been playing drums since I was 10 years old and was gracious enough to be given the opportunity to branch out into the world of percussion in high school. I was introduced to the wonderful world of mallet instruments, battery percussion, and a whole plethora of other smaller instruments.</p>
    <p>This is when I started to take the other percussion instruments much more seriously and started to develop and enhance my technique across as many instruments as possible. I took private lessons for a couple years to help with this. At that point, my musical career started to pay off. While at UW-Whitewater, I had the opportunity to perform with the drumline for 4 years, the percussion ensemble for 4 years, and the Wind Ensemble for 3 years.</p>
    <p>I have two notable accomplishments thanks to my passion for percussion. I performed at Lambeau Field during halftime for a Packers game with the marching band in September of 2017. I also played at Carnegie Hall in NYC with the Wind Ensemble in March of 2020, just days before the coronavirus caused just about everything to shut down!</p>
    <p>I currently perform for the ISU Big Red Marching Machine drumline and am having a blast doing it so far. Even though it has been an off season for us all year, it is still great to play drums. I am looking forward to the 2021 football season when hopefully we will be able to perform in front of people once again.</p>
    <p>I invite you to take a look around my musical adventures. I love performing for people whether it's in person or online. I would love some feedback on performance techniques as well as recording techniques if you can provide it to me!</p>
