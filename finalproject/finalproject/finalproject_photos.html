    <p>Hello, welcome to my photo gallery! If I were to rate myself on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best ever and 1 being I have never touched a camera in my life, I would rate myself a 5.5. In other words, I am in no way anywhere close to professional. But, with the right tools and the right environment, I can safely say I can make some pretty good looking photos!</p>
    <p>I have only really been doing photography as a hobby for a few years. It is not something that I can feel comfortable getting a job doing. I have taken a few classes on photography and learned about ISO, aperture, depth of field, etc. However, I still consider myself to be very new with that sort of thing and would have little to no clue on how to use these tools effectively. Most of the time, if the camera has an auto setting, I will tend to lean on that side until I eventually get more comfortable with the manual settings.</p>
    <p>I currently shoot with a Canon Rebel T3i with three interchangeable lenses as well as the camera on whatever smartphone I use (currently the Pixel 4a, one of the best smartphone cameras out there right now) and I have toyed around with a couple more higher end cameras such as the Canon EOS 70D. But, I am a bit too amateur to go anywhere near anything higher than what I have right now. Hopefully soon I will feel more confident to play around with something better and up my game!</p>
    <p>That being said, I still have gotten a bunch of shots that I am super happy with. Take a gander at my photo gallery and see for yourself. I would love to know what you think!</p>
