    <p>Welcome to my videos tab! I have always been fascinated with the idea of cinematography and movie making in general. I couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was about my fascination with the concept. It could have been the quality of the picture. It could have been the massive equipment that is brought on set and what it all does and how it helps the shot. It could be the advancement in said equipment to bring a better picture with less work.</p>
    <p>I currently shoot with a Canon Rebel T3i with three interchangeable lenses as well as the camera on whatever smartphone I use (currently the Pixel 4a, one of the best smartphone cameras out there right now) and I have toyed around with a couple more higher end cameras such as the Canon EOS 70D. But, I am a bit too amateur to go anywhere near anything higher than what I have right now. Hopefully soon I will feel more confident to play around with something better and up my game!</p>
    I also have a couple GoPros (A GoPro Hero 7 Silver and a AUKEY AC-LC2 *knock off GoPro*) handy as well as an assortment of different mounting systems for the GoPros. But, my most recent big boy purchase was a DJI Mavic Mini 2 drone last summer. It is super fun to play around with but there is so much more that it can do that I still have yet to unlock.</p>
    <p>Regardless, here are two cinematic videos I have shot and edited recently that I am personally very proud of and it would mean a lot to me if you would check them out and let me know what you think!</p>
    <p>* = Coming soon!</p>
