    <p class="textright">Bodies in sway to melody absent of rhythm, an offering
      To our only begotten engineer
      Broken contact with the eye within the prism, erase
      Black mirror scripture imparts
      In a world as foreign to us as our own hearts</p>

      "Humanity is secondary to Me"</p>

    <p class="textcenter">Hold me down
      I'm cancerous and I'm spreading out
      We will drown beneath the vices we disavow
      Small black screens are your only god now</p>

    <p class="textjustify">Creature writhing within a dreaming system, he oscillates
      As the science tries to manifest
      Resolution to man's every schism, erase
      Distraction is clandestine, but we all have the passcode
      Identities wander as autonomous shadows</p>

      <p class="textspace">The concept animates in reflective visage
      Man creates God in his own image</p>

      <p class="textheight">Hold me down
      I'm cancerous and I'm spreading out
      We will drown beneath the vices we disavow
      Small black screens are your only god now</p>

      <p class="textcenter">Lost and alone in a space void of color
      I'm here, breathing salt, ocean grave, going under, all we are is lost
      Connected and polarized, division is catalyzed
      Pseudo selves we fantasize, unity is bastardized</p>

      <p class="textspace">Lost and alone in a space void of color
      I'm here, breathing salt, ocean grave, going under, all we are is lost</p>
